= Micro Frontends Lab

== Getting Started

== Install the Pre-requisites

First, make sure you have the pre-requisites installed:

* Node (https://nodejs.org/)
* Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Java SDK 11 or higher (https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* Maven (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

We also recommend using either the Git Bash Shell or the Windows Subsystem for Linux if you're on Windows.

== Checkout the repo

Clone the `micro-frontends-lab` repo from github:

----
git clone https://github.com/kito99/micro-frontends-lab.git
----

Read the link:README.md[README file] for an overview of the project (don't follow the "Running" instructions quite yet).
In this lab, we will build the Orchestrator and setup Express to serve the different micro frontends.

== Client side integration

:sectnums:

== Create the Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is a simple bit of code that can route between different Web Components that are lazy-loaded.
Each of these Web Components can be a separate micro frontend built using different technologies, but wrapped in a Web Component.

The Orchestrator is written using pure JavaScript and the Vaadin Router.
To begin, change into the
`orchestrator` folder.
This folder contains a README, a basic `package.json`, a shell index.htnml.

=== Add navigation links

Let's start by adding some links to index.html to support our micro frontends.
Place the follow code in the `<body>` of the file:

[source,language="html",indent=0]
----
<div id="navigation">
    <a href="/app-one">App One</a>
    <a href="/app-two">App Two</a>
    <a href="/app-three">App Three</a>
</div>

<div id="outlet">
</div>
----

Here we've specified links for the different micro frontends, as well as an outlet where the router will render the selected app.

=== Add CSS

Let's make things look a little better.
Add the following to the `<head>` of the document:

[source,language="html",indent=0]
----
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
            font-size: 14px;
            color: #333;
            line-height: 24px;
        }

        #outlet {
            margin: 20px;
            border-radius: 4px;
            border: 1px solid #eee;
            background-color: #fafafa;
            padding: 16px;
            transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
        }

        #navigation > a {
            padding: 5px;
            color: #ffffff;
            border-radius: 4px;
            border: 1px solid #eee;
            background-color: #007ad9;
            text-decoration: none;
        }
    </style>
----

=== Setup Express

In order to work with the Orchestrator, we need a static web server, preferably one that supports server-side includes.
In the real world, this might be Ngnix, Apache, or a content-delivery network (like Akamai) or a caching proxy server (like Varnish or Squid).
For our purposes, we'll use Express.

=== Install packages

First, change to the root folder of the project and run `npm install express`.

=== Create server.js

Create a new file called `server.js` with the following code:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
var express = require('express');

var app = express();

// Add routes to micro-frontends here
app.use('*', express.static('orchestrator', {index: "index.html"}));

app.listen(8000);
----

This routes all pages to our main Orchestrator page.

=== Run Express

Now, let's run the server and view our page.
Run the command `node server.js` and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/.
You should see a simple page like the one below.

image::orchestrator-blank.png[]

Clicking on a link should just reload the page.

=== Add the Vaadin Router

Next, let's add the Vaadin Router so that the Orchestrator can dynamically load different micro frontends.
Read the https://vaadin.com/router[Vaadin Router docs] for more information about the router.
Change to the `orchestrator` folder.

Inside `index.html`, add the following code at the _end_ of the `<body>`:

[source,language="html",indent=0]
----
<script type="module">
    import {Router} from 'https://unpkg.com/@vaadin/router/dist/vaadin-router.min.js';

    const outlet = document.getElementById('outlet');
    const router = new Router(outlet);

    router.setRoutes([
        {
            path: '/',
            redirect: '/app-one'
        }
     ]);
</script>
----

First, note that we're using native JavaScript modules.
These are supported in all evergreen browsers.
We're loading the Vaadin Router from unpkg.com, but this could just as easily be installed locally via an npm package.

All this code does is wire up the `<div>` with the `id` "outlet" to the router, and map the root path to the micro frontend called  `app-one`.

[NOTE]
====
In a real app, this might be encapsulated into a web component (or at least a separate JS file) and routes may be separated out into another file and loaded dynamically by the router.
====

When you reload the page, it should work basically the same, except that when you click on a link, it won't reload the page.
Instead, you'll see an error message from the Vaadin Router in the console complaining that the routes are not defined.
We'll handle that next.

== Integrate App One

=== Build the app

Change to the `app-one` folder and follow the instructions in the README for building the app.
Once this is complete, there should be a bundle in the `app-one/build` folder ready to be loaded by the Orchestrator.

=== Add the app to the router

Change back to the `orchestrator` folder and add the new route to `index.html` inside of the array passed to `router.setRoutes()`:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
        {
            path: '/app-one',
            component: 'x-app-one',
            action: async () => {
                await import('/app/one/app-one.js');
            }
        },
----

Here, we're mapping the route to a specific web component called `x-app-one`, which we are loading asynchronously from the location `/app/one/app-one.js`.
Once the component is loaded, its contents will be placed inside the outlet.

=== Add the app to the Express

Next, we need to update `server.js` to handle the route  `/app/one/app-one.js`.
Change to the root folder and add the following to `server.js` _before_ the last route:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
app.use('/app/one', express.static('app-one/build'));
----

=== Run Express

Now, let's run the server and view our page.
Kill node (control-C), restart it with the command `node server.js`, and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/.
You should now see `app-one` embedded inside of the page:

image::orchestrator-app-one.png[]

Clicking on the other app links should display a blank outlet, as before.

== Integrate App Two

=== Build the app

Change to the `app-two` folder and follow the instructions in the README for building the app.
Once this is complete, there should be a bundle in the `app-two/elements` folder ready to be loaded by the Orchestrator.

=== Add the app to the router

Change back to the `orchestrator` folder and add the new route to `index.html` inside of the array passed to `router.setRoutes()`:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
        {
            path: '/app-two',
            component: 'x-app-two',
            action: async () => {
                await import('/app/two/app-two.js');
            }
        },
----

Here, we're mapping the route to a specific web component called `x-app-two`, which we are loading asynchronously from the location `/app/two/app-two.js`.
Once the component is loaded, its contents will be placed inside the outlet.

=== Add the app to the Express

Next, we need to update `server.js` to handle the route `/app/two/app-two.js`.
Change to the root folder and add the following to `server.js` _before_ the last route:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
app.use('/app/two', express.static('app-two/elements'));
----

=== Run Express

Now, let's run the server and view our page.
Kill node (control-C), restart it with the command `node server.js`, and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/.
Click on the App Two link.
You should now see `app-two` embedded inside of the page:

image::orchestrator-app-two.png[]

The App One link should work just as before, and the App Three link should display a blank outlet.

== Integrate App Three

=== Build the app

Change to the `app-three` folder and follow the instructions in the README for building the app.
Once this is complete, there should be a bundle in the `app-three/elements` folder ready to be loaded by the Orchestrator.

[NOTE]
====
Don't build `app-three-service` yet; we'll do that later.
====

=== Add the app to the router

Change back to the `orchestrator` folder and add the new route to `index.html` inside of the array passed to `router.setRoutes()`:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
        {
            path: '/app-three',
            component: 'x-app-three',
            action: async () => {
                await import('/app/three/app-three.js');
            }
        }
----

Here, we're mapping the route to a specific web component called `x-app-three`, which we are loading asynchronously from the location `/app/three/app-three.js`.
Once the component is loaded, its contents will be placed inside the outlet.

=== Add the app to the Express

Next, we need to update `server.js` to handle the route `/app/three/app-three.js`.
Change to the root folder and add the following to `server.js` _before_ the last route:

[source,language="javascript",indent=0]
----
app.use('/app/three', express.static('app-three/elements'));
----

=== Run Express

Now, let's run the server and view our page.
Kill node (control-C), restart it with the command `node server.js`, and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/.
Click on the App Two link.
You should now see `app-three` embedded inside of the page:

image::orchestrator-app-three-no-server.png[]

All three links should work now, but noticeably App Three has no data.
Let's handle that next.

=== Launch the App Three microservice

Unlike the other sample apps, App Three actually has a microservice back-end.
In order to launch it, change into the
`app-three-server` folder and follow the instructions in the README file.

=== Reload the page

Now, when you re-load the page, you should see actual data in the App Three:

__Congrats!
You have finished creating a micro frontend orchestator using Web Components!)__
